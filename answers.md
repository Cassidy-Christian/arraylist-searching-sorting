1. For regular search, I used MnMs, it goes space by space numerically. It could take one step to find it or N steps to findi ti depending on how many mnms are there. You would then return it that index. If the number isn't there, then the search would have to go through the entire length. 

normal search (there): on average, length/ 2 steps
normal search (missing): length
could go 2^19

For binary search, it starts in the middle of the array. 

search(list, t)
to find t, took one step. 

to find c, took 2 steps
to find a, took 3 steps
to find b, took 4 steps 
---- around log(2) to find the right index/letter
